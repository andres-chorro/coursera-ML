%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex4data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

load('ex4weights.mat');

% Unroll parameters 
nn_params = [Theta1(:) ; Theta2(:)];

%% ================ Part 3: Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
%  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
%  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
%  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
%  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
%  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
%  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
%
%  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
%  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
%  will get to implement the regularized cost.
